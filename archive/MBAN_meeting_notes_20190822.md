- ~50 students
- Start 26th Aug
- Mostly business, engineer, tech background

- There is a desire to improve the communication skills of students coming out of the program:
  * Improve understanding of problem statement <-> scientific statement
  * Get students to help live code
  * Use Piazza or Canvas as online forums
  * Get them to present group work
- Academic misconduct can be fairly high...
- Make sure code copying statement in syllabus...
- In lectures, try to enforce no phones, lateness etc...
- Food-for-thought lunchtime seminars on teaching issues
- RHL can be contacted for any help with student-related issues
- For group work, form random groups or get RHL to form the groups (tell them why, they need to learn to work with other people, be upfront that there can be conflict and provide some ideas on how to deal with it)
- Can use ipeer to get feedback after course
- Student's dislike not getting assignment feedback before final/next assignment/quiz
- Grade range is 76-84, RHL tells students that average is 80%
- 30% of 2019 students got jobs, students don't seem to be overly concerned about finding a job (they're confident that they will get one)


- maybe try to do course on canvas
- i can focus on python
- make sure there is connection between lecture content and assignments
- randomly assign groups
- course is 6 weeks long
- students are not to use phones during class
