# Overview

- Finish up with SVM's (cm09).
	- Bias-variance tradeoff of `C`
	- [Making Predictions, and Confidence (cm09)](https://vincenzocoia.github.io/BAIT509/class_meetings/cm09-svm.html#33_making_predictions,_and_confidence).
	- General [SVM's (cm09)](https://vincenzocoia.github.io/BAIT509/class_meetings/cm09-svm.html#6_support_vector_machines)
	- SVM coding example (see worksheet)
- Summary of course
- Bonus material: Alternatives to Accuracy: false positives/negatives, ROC, F1-score, AUC.
- Work on your final projects, if time remains.

# Alternatives to Accuracy

1. [Breast cancer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincenzocoia/BAIT509/master/data/breast_cancer.csv) data set ([source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer))
2. Calculate accuracies of some models. Include "all negative" model, too.
3. Make confusion matrices; define FPR and TPR (and synonyms); define aggregate measures.
4. Try different thresholds.
5. Introduce ROC: X=FPR, Y=TPR. Compare ROC for all three models.
6. Use case: choosing a threshold; AUC to evaluate overall model performance.
