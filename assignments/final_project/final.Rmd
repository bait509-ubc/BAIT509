Your task is to address a business question using machine learning, in the form of a report. Your report should contain the following components:

1. Identification of the business question, and how you distilled this to one or more statistical questions. Be sure to justify why you think the statistical questions are (or could be) useful for addressing the business question.
2. A discussion of the machine learning methods to consider for this analysis. You are encouraged to use methods from other courses, but do include at least one method taught in this course. Include a discussion on the model assumptions and whether they are appropriate/realistic. 


## Assessment

We are expecting you to distill the business question down to one statistical question. Identifying more than one statistical question is above and beyond.
