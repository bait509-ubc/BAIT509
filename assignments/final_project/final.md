# BAIT 509 Final Project

Your task is to address a business question using machine learning, in the form of a report. 

__Due date__: Tuesday, April 3, at 24:00. 

__Audience__: The primary audience of this report is the BAIT 509 teaching team (there will be a component of your report where the audience is a hypothetical client who is not an expert in supervised learning -- see below for more details.). 

Your report should contain the following components, not necessarily in the following order.

### A discussion about questions

Identification of the business question and corresponding statistical question. You are only expected to ask one statistical question, but identifying more than one indicates that you've gone above and beyond. Be sure to include the following discussion points:

- In what ways is this statistical question useful? That is, in what ways does it contain the essence of the business question? 
- What of the business question is missing from the statistical question?

### A discussion about the model

Fit one (or more, if appropriate) supervised learning model to answer your statistical question. You can use any supervised learning method -- not just the ones discussed in BAIT 509. Include a discussion on why you are proposing this model in particular, over others. In particular, how was this model chosen according to the following two components:

- Human choice: There are some decisions in the modelling process that we can justify based on logic, or based on things we know to be true in the real world. This may be just cause for instigating model assumptions, or believing in certain supervised learning methods over others.
- Numerical choice: This includes the estimation procedure of the model, and selecting one model over others using numerical scores. 

Be sure to also provide enough information about the final model(s) so that someone would be able to code the model, without going through a selection process. For example, in linear regression, this means the coefficient estimates and the predictors you decided to use. For kNN, this means the value of $k$, and any weight function if you used one.

### Other Components

Some background on the business question, if you're using your own data.
