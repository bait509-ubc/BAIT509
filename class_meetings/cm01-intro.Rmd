## GitHub

Your participation will be assessed in class, as well as your attempts at doing the in-class exercises. Be sure to commit and push to your github repo while doing class exercises. I'll be using Source Tree to communicate between my laptop and GitHub.

- 5%: attempting the in-class exercises, as assessed through your commit history. 
    - Key word here is _attempt_ -- we're looking for effort here, not correctness. 
- 5%: in-class discussion
    - You'll be given the opportunity to briefly present your in-class exercises.


## LAB

- Give an exercise with discrete and continuous $Y$ with no predictors. Then introduce a categorical predictor. Then a continuous predictor (but without the categorical).
