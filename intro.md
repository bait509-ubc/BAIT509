# BAIT509 - Business Applications of Machine Learning

This is the home page for the 2020/2021 iteration of the course BAIT 509 at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Please see the [syllabus](https://github.com/bait509-ubc/BAIT509/blob/master/BAIT509-2022.pdf) for more information about the course. Current students should refer to the [UBC Canvas course website](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/82520) for the most up-to-date content and announcements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1.	Describe fundamental machine learning concepts such as: supervised and unsupervised learning, regression and classification, overfitting, training/validation/testing error, parameters and hyperparameters, and the golden rule.
2.	Broadly explain how common machine learning algorithms work, including: na√Øve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression.
3.	Identify when and why to apply data pre-processing techniques such as scaling and one-hot encoding.
4.	Use Python and the scikit-learn package to develop an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline.
5.	Apply and interpret machine learning methods to carry out supervised learning projects and to answer business objectives.
