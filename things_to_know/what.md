# What: Learning Outcomes 

## Course Objectives
 
 1.	Describe fundamental machine learning concepts such as: supervised and unsupervised learning, regression and classification, overfitting, training/validation/testing error, parameters and hyperparameters, and the golden rule.
2.	Broadly explain how common machine learning algorithms work, including: na√Øve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression.
3.	Identify when and why to apply data pre-processing techniques such as scaling and one-hot encoding.
4.	Use Python and the scikit-learn package to develop an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline.
5.	Apply and interpret machine learning methods to carry out supervised learning projects and to answer business objectives.
