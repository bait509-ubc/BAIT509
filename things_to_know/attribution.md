This course has been built using the material from many people. The original content was created by [Mike Gelbart](https://www.mikegelbart.com/) for his Master of Data Science course DSCI571. Since then [Varada Kolhatkar](https://kvarada.github.io/) has contributed and developed the material further. The original BAIT509 material was created by [Tomas Beuzen ](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/), significantly reworked by [Hayley Boyce](https://www.hayleyfboyce.com/) and then slightly modified by [Joel Ostblom](https://joelostblom.com/).

It's import to also credit material originally from UBC's CPSC340 course by [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/). Many of these concepts and terms are directly derived from his content. 

Much of this material will be steaming from the [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ml-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en/) course developed by myself, Mike and Varada.
