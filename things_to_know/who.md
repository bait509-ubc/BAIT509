# Who: Joel Ostblom

Hello everyone! I developed a passion for data science and reproducibility during my PhD through the development of quantitative image analysis pipelines for studying stem cell and developmental biology. Since then I have co-created or lead the development of several courses and workshops at the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia. I care deeply about spreading data literacy and excitement over programmatic data analysis, which I contribute to via open source projects and data science learning resources.

For this course, I plan to not only teach you some key topics of machine learning but I really want to make sure that it's an enjoyable process. Data science is one of my favourite subject to teach and I hope that it shows in the next 5 weeks.
