# Who: Hayley Boyce

Hi! My name is Hayley.

Welcome to BAIT 509. Let me introduce myself a little. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from the University of Western Ontario and a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. For the last year and a half I have developed online courses for the Key Capabilities in Data Science program from UBC's Extended Learning, Lab instructed for the Master of Data Science program, contributed to an online course framework as well as created a Tableau seminar-workshop. 

I have worked with companies like Riversol Skincare and Freshprep making visualization and prediction tools. 

For this course, I plan to not only teach you some key topics of machine learning but I really want to make sure that it's an enjoyable process. Machine Learning is one of my favourite subject to teach and I hope that it shows in the next 5 weeks.
