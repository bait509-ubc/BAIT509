# What: Learning Outcomes 

## Course Objectives
 
 1.	Describe fundamental machine learning concepts such as: supervised and unsupervised learning, regression and classification, overfitting, training/validation/testing error, parameters and hyperparameters, and the golden rule.
2. Broadly explain how common machine learning algorithms work, including: na√Øve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression.
3. Identify when and why to apply data pre-processing techniques such as scaling and one-hot encoding.
4. Use Python and the scikit-learn package to develop an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline.
5. Apply and interpret machine learning methods to carry out supervised learning projects and to answer business objectives.

### Lecture 1

- Explain motivation to study machine learning.
- Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Differentiate between classification and regression problems.
- Explain machine learning terminology such as features, targets, training, and error.
- Explain the `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigm and use `.score()` method of ML models.
- Broadly describe how decision trees make predictions.
- Use `DecisionTreeClassifier()` and `DecisionTreeRegressor()` to build decision trees using scikit-learn.
- Explain the difference between parameters and hyperparameters.
- Explain how decision boundaries change with `max_depth`.

### Lecture 2

- Explain the concept of generalization.
- Split a dataset into train and test sets using `train_test_split` function.
- Explain the difference between train, validation, test, and "deployment" data.
- Identify the difference between training error, validation error, and test error.
- Explain cross-validation and use `cross_val_score()` and `cross_validate()` to calculate cross-validation error.
- Explain overfitting, underfitting, and the fundamental tradeoff.
- State the golden rule and identify the scenarios when it's violated.
