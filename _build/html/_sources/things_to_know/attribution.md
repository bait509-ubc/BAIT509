This course has been built using the material from many people. The original content was created by [Mike Gelbart](https://www.mikegelbart.com/) for his Master of Data Science course DSCI571. Since then [Varada Kolhatkar](https://kvarada.github.io/) has contributed and developed the material further. The original BAIT509 material was created by [Tomas Beuzen ](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/) from which many lectures are directly adapted. 

Much of this material will be steaming from the [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://ml-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en/) course developed by myself, Mike and Varada.
