# Who: Quan Nguyen

Hello everyone! I am Quan Nguyen, your instructor for BAIT 509 - Machine learning applications in business. I am curently an instructor in the UBC Master of Data Science program, and before that, I was working as a postdoc researcher at the University of Michigan. As someone with a business/economics background, I have always been fascinated by how data-driven insights can transform business strategies and economic policies. In my classes, I aim to bridge the gap between technical data science skills and their practical applications in the business world, ensuring that my students not only learn the latest techniques in machine learning but also understand how to apply these tools to solve real-world business challenges. I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experiences with you and am excited to embark on this learning journey together.

Fun facts about me:
- I'm an avid bouldering enthusiast. My climbing has left my fingertips covered in calluses to the point where my laptop and phone can no longer read my fingerprints! 
- I have a cat name Miso who is super fluffy and demanding. 
- I enjoy playing boardgame with friends, and get really competitive at those...
