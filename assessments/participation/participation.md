# BAIT 509 Participation

10% of your final grade in BAIT 509 will be based on participation. You will be graded according to two equally weighted components. 

__Deadline for online contributions__: Wednesday, March 28, at 12:00 (i.e., the end of Class Meeting 10).

## Submission Instructions

On Connect, you'll see a place for you to "submit your participation". Instructions are there, but all you have to do is put a link to your github repo(s) containing your in-class work. Please do this before the deadline, so that we can get started with grading. 

## In-class Exercises (5%)

Class meetings will have exercises to be attempted in-class. To obtain full points for this section, you are expected to attempt all exercises. Exemptions will only be permitted on a case-by-case basis _ahead of time_ by the instructor. 

The key word here is _attempt_ -- we're looking for effort here, not correctness.

Specifically, we will be grading you based on your commit history and your `git diff`s (changes to your exercise files). Be sure to commit and push to your github repo while doing class exercises, as we will be looking at your commit timestamps to see that they correspond to class meetings.

Class meetings the didn't have any (non-assignment) in-class exercises:

- cm04
- cm05
- cm06
- cm10

## Discussion (5%)

Here, you'll be graded based on your contribution to class discussions, either remotely or in-class. Note that attendance is a prerequisite for this, so attendance does not contribute to your grade, but _can_ detract from your grade. Your opportunities for contributing to discussion are as follows.

- Asking questions or commenting in class.
- You'll be given the opportunity (or asked) to briefly "present" your in-class exercises.
    - Note: don't fret if you or your team can't figure out the answer to a question you are presenting! You won't be penalized _at all_ for not knowing, or getting an answer wrong, but at least try. The floor will be turned to the class for an answer, or I will chime in with some insight. 
- Participation in online discussion via [GitHub issues on the BAIT509 repo](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/BAIT509/issues). See the Class Meeting 01 notes for more details on what this means.

__Note__: Conversations/questions via email _do not count_ toward your participation grade, because they are hidden from the rest of the class. Only send an email if you need to send a message privately.
