# BAIT 509 Participation

10% of your final grade in BAIT 509 will be based on participation.

## In-class Exercises

Class meetings will have exercises to be attempted in-class. You are expected to attempt the exercises, and upload your attempts to [canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca). __Submissions do not have to be correct__. We're only looking for the attempt.

## Discussion 

Here, you'll be graded based on your contribution to class discussions, either remotely or in-class. Note that attendance is a prerequisite for this, so attendance does not contribute to your grade, but _can_ detract from your grade. Your opportunities for contributing to discussion are as follows.

- Participation in online discussion via [canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca).
- Asking questions or commenting in class.

__Note__: Conversations/questions via email _do not count_ toward your participation grade, because they are hidden from the rest of the class. Only send an email if you need to send a message privately.
