# BAIT509 - Business Applications of Machine Learning

This repo contains materials for the 2018 (inaugural!) iteration of BAIT509 at UBC. In particular, you can find:

- The syllabus can be found at [syllabus.pdf](syllabus.pdf).
- Class meeting notes can be found in the [`class_meetings`](/class_meetings) folder.
- Instructions for your five assessments can be found in the [`assessments`](/assessments) folder.

This repo _does not_ contain things that really ought to be private. We'll use [UBC Connect](https://connect.ubc.ca/) for these. This includes:

- Your grades and feedback on your assessments.
- Solutions to the assignments. 

Since BAIT 509 is brand new, material in this repo will be under flux for the duration of the course. This is different from most courses, where you're only shown material when it's ready. __NOTE:__ This means that you can see assessments before they're ready too, so don't start one unless you've been told it's ready! See below for more details.

This very manuscript is intended to help you navigate the course, kind of like a more practical version of your syllabus.

## Assessments

Assessments can have one of three statuses:

- NA (Not Available): This assessment is not ready yet for you to begin.
- OPEN: This assessment is ready for you to work on.
- CLOSED: This assessment is due. We will not be accepting further work on this assessment.

A change in status will be accompanied with an Issue creation/comment, so you will be notified of it (_if_ you're [`Watch`ing](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/#watching-a-single-repository) the repo!)

## Useful Resources

Here are some resources you might find useful for the course. Let me know if you find something you find useful, and I can add it here.

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (aka ISLR).
	- A very well-written book covering a lot of concepts in supervised learning. 
- [Happy git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)
	- Jenny Bryan's book on just about all the tools we're using in this course, and how they all work together. Doesn't include jupyter notebooks (?).
