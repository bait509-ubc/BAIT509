# BAIT509 - Business Applications of Machine Learning

This is the home page for BAIT 509 at The University of British Columbia, displaying the 2019 iteration of the course. The syllabus can be found at [sauder_syllabus.pdf](sauder_syllabus.pdf), but anything listed in on this website will take precedence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be expected to be able to:

- Explain what ML is, in the context of errors and model functions. 
- Understand and implement the machine learning paradigms in both R and python for a variety of ML methods.
- Identify a data table based on a machine learning problem
- Understand the types of error, and how this influences model choice/goodness
- Build and justify a ML model. 
- Understand how ML fits into the greater scope of solving a business problem

| [cm03](/class_meetings/cm03-local.md); model fitting in python ([.html](/class_meetings/cm03-model_fitting-python.html) / [.ipynb](/class_meetings/cm03-model_fitting-python.ipynb)); model fitting in R ([.html](/class_meetings/cm03-model_fitting-r.html) / [.Rmd](/class_meetings/cm03-model_fitting-r.Rmd)) | Local methods | [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)'s "K-Nearest Neighbors" section (in Section 2.2.3) on page 39; and Section 7.6 ("Local Regression"). |
| [cm04](/class_meetings/cm04-selection.md); cross-validation example ([.R](/class_meetings/cm04-worksheet.R)) | Model Selection | [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) Section 5.1 |
| [cm05](/class_meetings/cm05-trees.md); CART example ([.R](/class_meetings/cm05-worksheet.R)) | Classification and Regression Trees | [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) Section 8.1 |

[This blog post by altexsoft](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/supervised-learning-use-cases-low-hanging-fruit-in-data-science-for-businesses/) does a good job outlining the use of supervised learning in business. |

| [cm09](/class_meetings/cm09-svm.md) | SVM | Section 9.1, 9.2, 9.4 in [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The details aren't all that important. 9.3 is quite advanced, but I'll be discussing the main idea behind it in class. |
| [cm10](/class_meetings/cm10-selection.md) | Feature and model selection | We'll be touching on 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 from [ISLR](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), but only briefly. |
