# BAIT509 - Business Applications of Machine Learning

This is the GitHub home page for the 2019/2020 iteration of the course BAIT 509 at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Please see the [syllabus](BAIT509_syllabus.pdf) for more information about the course. Current students should refer to the [UBC Canvas course website](https://canvas.ubc.ca/) for the most up-to-date content and announcements.

This repository is avaiable as an easy-to-navigate [website](https://bait509-ubc.github.io/BAIT509/).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Describe fundamental machine learning concepts such as: supervised and unsupervised learning, regression and classification, overfitting, training and testing error;
2. Broadly explain how common machine learning algorithms work, including: naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods;
3. Implement a machine learning pipeline (i.e., loading data, creating a machine learning model, testing the model) in Python; and,
4. Apply and interpret machine learning methods to carry out supervised learning projects and to answer business objectives.
